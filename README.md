- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted), an open source Python library for making multimedia applications

## Rules to play the game
- As soon as the game starts, the score will be initialised to zero, which can be viewed at the top left of the game.
- A snake and a ball will be visible
- The directions to move in the game are as follows
- - `Right` -> `right arrow` or `D`
- - `Left` -> `left arrow` or `A`
- - `Down` -> `down arrow` or `S`
- - `Up` -> `upwards arrow` or `W`
- As the snake eats the ball, its size and score get increased.
- Touching to the walls leads to the death of the snake and hence the games haults displaying the score.
